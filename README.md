Iris Dataset Analysis Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project focuses on the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains four key features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
These features describe the physical attributes of flowers from three different species of the Iris plant:

Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica
The goal of this notebook is to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify the iris flowers based on the given features. The dataset is small and relatively simple, making it ideal for beginners in machine learning and neural network development. In this project, we will:

Explore the Iris dataset
Preprocess the data
Train a neural network to classify the species of iris flowers
Evaluate the performance of the model
The code will demonstrate how to build and train an ANN using Python and relevant machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

By the end of the project, we aim to achieve an accurate classification of iris flower species, showcasing the practical use of neural networks in solving real-world problems.
